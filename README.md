# Statistical-Library
A stats library to create a ton of functions from R into Python and other code snippets for easier future use

## Navigation
If there's a main.py in root directory, that's my testing code to make sure the functions work

All the functions you want are in ./library

All my data files are in the ./csv folder

## Reason
I learnt all my statistical coding in R and RStudio, but all my projects are in python for now, so might as well move them over
